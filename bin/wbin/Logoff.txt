1. ABOUT
========
  Logoff is a simple program designed to log you off your current session
 of Windows 95 / Windows NT.
  Its main motivation is for those people that log on and off from their
 machines a lot (esp. under Windows NT), to change permissions.
  I believe that this is a worthwhile program because I use it myself - I
 like using the console for a lot of my work.  It seems more natural to me
 than having to use the menus.

2. USAGE
========
  Simply run "logoff" and a dialog will pop-up asking for confirmation.
  If you select yes you will be logged off, otherwise you won't.
  Alternatively you may type "logoff /q" and you will be logged off without
 the need for confirmation.  Ideal for a timed logoff, or a shortcut.


3. ABOUT
========
  Logoff was written, and compiled under Visual C+ v4.  Its source code
 is included, should you be interested in how the program works, or if
 you would like to improve / modify the app.
  If you like the program please send me an email...  After all I'm not
 asking for money, and I currently have a job!
